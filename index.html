        <h2 id="about">About Dylan</h2>
        <p>To let you know a little about me, my wife and I were married in September of 2020 and we just started our family with our first born in September of 2021.</p>
        <p>I have always been interested in two things: the way things work, computers.  Software development is the perfect career path for me due to my interest in understanding how the software works.  This Thinkful program has already shown me so much in the way of creating a website and the foundation it stands on.  My dream job after completing the Thinkful program would to work with a company who is related to, or directly in the gaming industry.  Gaming is a hobby of mine, and is one of the ways that I use to relax and decompress.</p>
        <p>Some of my hobbies include:</p>
        <ul class="center">
          <li>Video Games</li>
          <li>Working out</li>
          <li>Hanging out with friends</li>
          <li>Spending time with my family</li>
          <li>Playing sports</li>
        </ul>
