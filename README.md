# Website Portfolio

![Alt text](./images/siteView.PNG?raw=true "Optional Title")

## This is my website portfolio for my Thinkful program.

There are three main sections of this website.
1. The Header which includes anchor links.
2. Body which includes an Intro, About Me, and a Contact.
3. The footer which contains the link to the Thinkful website. 

I utilized HTML and CSS to complete this assignment.  
Took advantage of using relative URLs along with Absolute URLs to direct the user to different parts of the application, and to other websites.
